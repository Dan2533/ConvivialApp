Built in React with a Spring Boot backend. This app was created to provide fun activities for children that promote togetherness, learning and creativity. I was inspired by Pinterest to create this app. I wanted to provide a space for beautiful photos combined with instructions all in one place. 

I'm almost finished with the back end of this project. The next phase of the project will entail designing the front end components using React. I am excited to get started! :)
